I am a PhD student in theoretical computer science in Toulouse, France. My subject is
the theory of distributed computing, more specifically the use of rounds to
abstract away fault and communication models.

My other interests include Effective Altruism, AI safety, Writing and Reading Fiction, Rust and
many more.
